## Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes

This project aims to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expected that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam). The algorithm did way better than expected with its accuracy score being 98.7%.

To train the algorithm, this project used a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
